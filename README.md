### Overview

This repository is for hosting and posting my homework assignments for the Programming with Data course.

### About myself :cn:@:us::scorpius:

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Industrial/Organizational psychology at USF. My research interests are: 

* Psychometrics, item response theory
* Personnel selection, individual differences as predictors of work outcomes 
* Vocational interests, career aspirations & expectations, career fit

I've created an R package **bmggum** that estimates the Multidimensional Generalized Graded Unfolding Model (MGGUM) using Bayesian method with my collaborator Bo Zhang at TAMU. The details of the package can be found at <https://github.com/Naidantu/bmggum>.
