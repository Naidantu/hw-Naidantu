I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Industrial/Organizational psychology at USF. My research interests are **psychometric**, **item response theory**, and **individual differences** (e.g., vocational interests) as predictors of outcomes in the workplace. 

I've created an R package **BMGGUM** that estimates Multidimensional Generalized Graded
Unfolding Model (MGGUM) using Bayesian method with my collaborator Bo Zhang at TAMU. The details of tha package can be found at <https://github.com/Naidantu/BMGGUM>.
